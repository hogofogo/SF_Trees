# SF_Trees

Data is from Kaggle.

The purpose of this projects was to:
Examine the tree species in SF
Analyze a selection of top (5) species and map their frequency distributions on to SF map
Build a interactive app (server and UI) to interactively regraph density distributions depending on the tree species selected.

For results of graphing analysis look at .html file (download first; git won't show the graphics).

For the interactive app, launch it from R studio after running SF_trees.Rmd

All the work is done in R.
