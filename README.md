# SF_Trees

The purpose of this projects was to:
Examine the tree species in SF
Analyze a selection of top (5) species and map their frequency distributions on to SF map
Build a shiny app (server and UI) to interactively regraph density distributions depending on the tree species selected

For results of graphing analysis look at .html file

For the interactive app, launch it from R studio after running SF_trees.Rmd

All the work is done in R.
