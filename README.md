# SF_Trees

Data is from Kaggle.

The purpose of this projects was to:

-  Examine tree species in SF and their distribution
-  Analyze a selection of top (5) species and map their frequency distributions on to SF map
-  Build a interactive app (server and UI) to interactively regraph density distributions depending on the tree species selected.

This is an interactive Shiny app representing the final six graphs that can be flipped through using a slider

For results of graphing analysis look at .html file (download first; git won't show the graphics).

For the interactive app, launch it from R studio after running SF_trees.Rmd

All the work is done in R.
